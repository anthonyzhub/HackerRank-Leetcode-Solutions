# HackerRank-&Leetcode-Solutions

Whether you're a student or an experienced professional, it is recommended to practice your technical skills before an interview. HackerRank and Leetcode both have technical questions for everyone to prepare for a job interview. For me, I like to save questions and its solution after successfully solving them. You never know if a problem may resurface in a job interview with minor differences.

In this repository, each file is named after the problem and includes the link to the question.

Good luck on your interview!
